                <p>
                    Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming
                    language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very
                    high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable
                    power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls
                    and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible
                    in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for
                    applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is
                    portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows
                    2000 and later

            <article>
                <p>
                    Here’s a very brief summary of what started it all, written by Guido
                    van Rossum:
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had extensive experience with implementing an interpreted language
                    in the ABC group at CWI, and from working with this group I had
                    learned a lot about language design. This is the origin of many Python
                    features, including the use of indentation for statement grouping and
                    the inclusion of very-high-level data types (although the details are
                    all different in Python).
                </p>

                <p>
                    I had a number of gripes about the ABC language, but also liked many
                    of its features. It was impossible to extend the ABC language (or its
                    implementation) to remedy my complaints – in fact its lack of
                    extensibility was one of its biggest problems. I had some experience
                    with using Modula-2+ and talked with the designers of Modula-3 and
                    read the Modula-3 report. Modula-3 is the origin of the syntax and
                    semantics used for exceptions, and some other Python features.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was working in the Amoeba distributed operating system group at CWI.
                    We needed a better way to do system administration than by writing
                    either C programs or Bourne shell scripts, since Amoeba had its own
                    system call interface which wasn’t easily accessible from the Bourne
                    shell. My experience with error handling in Amoeba made me acutely
                    aware of the importance of exceptions as a programming language
                    feature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It occurred to me that a scripting language with a syntax like ABC but
                    with access to the Amoeba system calls would fill the need. I realized
                    that it would be foolish to write an Amoeba-specific language, so I
                    decided that I needed a language that was generally extensible.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During the 1989 Christmas holidays, I had a lot of time on my hand, so
                    I decided to give it a try. During the next year, while still mostly
                    working on it in my own time, Python was used in the Amoeba project
                    with increasing success, and the feedback from colleagues made me add
                    many early improvements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In February 1991, after just over a year of development, I decided to
                    post to USENET. The rest is in the Misc/HISTORY file.

            <article>
                <p>
                    Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language that can
                    be applied to many different classes of problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The language comes with a large standard library that covers areas
                    such as string processing (regular expressions, Unicode, calculating
                    differences between files), Internet protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP,
                    XML-RPC, POP, IMAP, CGI programming), software engineering (unit
                    testing, logging, profiling, parsing Python code), and operating
                    system interfaces (system calls, filesystems, TCP/IP sockets). Look at
                    the table of contents for The Python Standard Library to get an idea
                    of what’s available. A wide variety of third-party extensions are also
                    available. Consult the Python Package Index to find packages of
                    interest to you.

                <p>Yes.</p>

                <p>
                    It is still common to start students with a procedural and statically
                    typed language such as Pascal, C, or a subset of C++ or Java. Students
                    may be better served by learning Python as their first language.
                    Python has a very simple and consistent syntax and a large standard
                    library and, most importantly, using Python in a beginning programming
                    course lets students concentrate on important programming skills such
                    as problem decomposition and data type design. With Python, students
                    can be quickly introduced to basic concepts such as loops and
                    procedures. They can probably even work with user-defined objects in
                    their very first course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For a student who has never programmed before, using a statically
                    typed language seems unnatural. It presents additional complexity that
                    the student must master and slows the pace of the course. The students
                    are trying to learn to think like a computer, decompose problems,
                    design consistent interfaces, and encapsulate data. While learning to
                    use a statically typed language is important in the long term, it is
                    not necessarily the best topic to address in the students’ first
                    programming course.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many other aspects of Python make it a good first language. Like Java,
                    Python has a large standard library so that students can be assigned
                    programming projects very early in the course that do something.
                    Assignments aren’t restricted to the standard four-function calculator
                    and check balancing programs. By using the standard library, students
                    can gain the satisfaction of working on realistic applications as they
                    learn the fundamentals of programming. Using the standard library also
                    teaches students about code reuse. Third-party modules such as PyGame
                    are also helpful in extending the students’ reach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Python’s interactive interpreter enables students to test language
                    features while they’re programming. They can keep a window with the
                    interpreter running while they enter their program’s source in another
                    window. If they can’t remember the methods for a list, they can do
                    something like this:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> L = [] >>> dir(L) ['__add__', '__class__', '__contains__',
          '__delattr__', '__delitem__', '__dir__', '__doc__', '__eq__',
          '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__getitem__', '__gt__',
          '__hash__', '__iadd__', '__imul__', '__init__', '__iter__', '__le__',
          '__len__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__new__', '__reduce__',
          '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__reversed__', '__rmul__',
          '__setattr__', '__setitem__', '__sizeof__', '__str__',
          '__subclasshook__', 'append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count', 'extend',
          'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort'] >>> [d for d in
          dir(L) if '__' not in d] ['append', 'clear', 'copy', 'count',
          'extend', 'index', 'insert', 'pop', 'remove', 'reverse', 'sort'] >>>
          help(L.append) Help on built-in function append: append(...)
          L.append(object) -> None -- append object to end >>> L.append(1) >>> L
          [1]</code>
                <p>
                    With the interpreter, documentation is never far from the student as
                    they are programming.

                    There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional.
                    The keyword 'elif' is short for 'else if', and is useful to avoid
                    excessive indentation. An if ...elif ....elif ... sequence is a
                    substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.

                    The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to
                    in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic
                    progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the
                    ability to define both the iteration step and halting conditions (as
                    C), Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a
                    list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For
                    example (no pun intended):
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> # Measure some strings: ... words = ['cat', 'window',
          'defenestrate'] >>> for w in words: ... print(w, len(w)) ... cat 3
          window 6 defenestrate 12
        </code>
                <p>
                    If you need to modify the sequence you are iterating over while inside
                    the loop (for example to duplicate selected items), it is recommended
                    that you first make a copy, ilterating over a sequence does not
                    implicity make a copy. The slice notation make this especially
                    onvenient:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> for w in words[:]: # Loop over a slice copy of the entire list.
          ... if len(w) > 6: ... words.insert(0, w) ... >>> words
          ['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
        </code>
                <p>
                    With <span>for a words:</span>, The example would attempt to create an
                    infinite list, inserting <span>defenestrate</span> over and over
                    again.

                    If you do need to iterate over a sequence of numbers, the built-in
                    function reange() comes in handy. It generates arithmetic
                    progressions:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> for i in range(5): ... print(i) ... 0 1 2 3 4
        </code>
                <p>
                    The given end point is never part of the generated sequence;
                    <span>range(10)</span> generates 10 value, the legal indices for items
                    of a sequence of lenght 10. It is possible to let the range stat at
                    another number, or to lspecity a different increment (even negative;
                    sometimes this is called the 'step'):
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          range(5, 10) 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 range(0, 10, 3) 0, 3, 6, 9 range(-10, -100,
          -30) -10, -40, -70
        </code>
                <p>
                    To iterate over the indices of a sequence, you can combine range() and
                    len() as follows:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb'] >>> for i in
          range(len(a)): ... print(i, a[i]) ... 0 Mary 1 had 2 a 3 little 4 lamb
        </code>
                <p>
                    In most such cases, however, it is convenient to use the enumerate()
                    functions, see looping Techniques.
                </p>
                <p>A strange thing happens if you just print a range</p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> print(range(10)) range(0, 10)
        </code>
                <p>
                    In many ways the object returned by range() behaves as if it is a
                    list, but in fact it isn’t. It is an object which returns the
                    successive items of the desired sequence when you iterate over it, but
                    it doesn’t really make the list, thus saving space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We say such an object is iterable, that is, suitable as a target for
                    functions and constructs that expect something from which they can
                    obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. We have seen
                    that the for statement is such an iterator. The function list() is
                    another; it creates lists from iterables:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> list( range(5)) [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        </code>
                <p>
                    Later we will see more functions that return iterables and take
                    iterables as argument.

                    The break statement, like in C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing
                    for or while loop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop
                    terminates though exhaustion of the list (with for) or when the
                    condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is
                    terminated by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following
                    loop, which searches for prime numbers:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> for n in range(2, 10): ... for x in range(2, n): ... if n % x ==
          0: ... print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x) ... break ... else: ... # loop
          fell through without finding a factor ... print(n, 'is a prime
          number') ... 2 is a prime number 3 is a prime number 4 equals 2 * 2 5
          is a prime number 6 equals 2 * 3 7 is a prime number 8 equals 2 * 4 9
          equals 3 * 3
        </code>
                <p>
                    (Yes, this is the correct code. Look closely: the else clause belongs
                    to the for loop, not the if statement.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    When used with a loop, the else clause has more in common with the
                    else clause of a try statement than it does that of if statements: a
                    try statement’s else clause runs when no exception occurs, and a
                    loop’s else clause runs when no break occurs. For more on the try
                    statement and exceptions, see Handling Exceptions.

                <p>
                    The continue statement, also borrowed from C, continues with the next
                    iteration for the loop:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> for num in range(2, 10): ... if num % 2 == 0: ... print("Found an
          even number", num) ... continue ... print("Found a number", num) Found
          an even number 2 Found a number 3 Found an even number 4 Found a
          number 5 Found an even number 6 Found a number 7 Found an even number
          8 Found a number 9

                    the pass statement does nothing. It can be used when a statement is
                    required syntactically but the program requires no action. For
                    example:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> while True: ... pass # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
          ...
        </code>
                <p>This is commonly used for creating minimal classes:</p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> class MyEmptyClass: ... pass_statements ...
        </code>
                <p>
                    Another place pass can be used is as a place-holder for a function or
                    conditional body when you are working on new code, allowing you to
                    keep thinking at a more abstract level. The pass is silently ignored:
                </p>
                <code class="code">
          >>> def initlog(*args): ... pass # Remember to implement this! ...
